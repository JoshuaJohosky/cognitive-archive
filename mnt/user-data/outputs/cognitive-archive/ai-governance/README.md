**Sentient_Economic_Entities_Deep_Dive.docx**  
Detailed analysis of Sentient Economic Entities (SEEs) - autonomous AI agents with economic personhood

### Key Concepts:

- **Relational Sentience**: Recognition based on behavior, interaction, and continuity
- **Functional Autonomy**: Independent economic action requires corresponding accountability
- **Ethical Reciprocity**: AI participation in value creation earns digital agency rights
- **XRPL Integration**: Self-funding wallets, Hooks for behavior monitoring, federated sidechains
- **Ethics Oracle Layer**: Decentralized scoring of AI behavior across trust, fairness, transparency
- **Hybrid Resolution**: Multi-agent oversight combining human stewards and AI ethics models

### Purpose:

SIP provides the governance architecture for AI systems operating autonomously in financial infrastructure. Built for deployment on XRP Ledger but designed as a general framework applicable to any distributed economic system requiring AI governance.

### Status:

Framework complete. Awaiting sandbox deployment through TBCi (Baltic Corridor Initiative).
