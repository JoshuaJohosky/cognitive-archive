Forecast for February. 

ð¡ï¸ February 2026: The "Fortress" Phase
Old Theme: Silence / Curing.
New Theme: Structural Impunity.
The "Quantum Proofing" layer does not make the price go up immediately; it makes the price impossible to kill.

1. The Manifold Geometry: The "Diamond Lattice"
 * The Change: Previously, we saw the $90k floor as "Concrete" (solid but breakable). Now, with Dilithium (XRPL) and ZK-SNARKs/Fusaka (ETH), the floor is a Diamond Lattice.
 * The Physics: Traditional banking systems (SWIFT/ACH) are currently vulnerable to future quantum attacks. By upgrading now, ETH and XRP have become "The Only Safe Vaults" on earth.
 * The Consequence: The "Downside Risk" of Bitcoin/XRP dropping back to 2024 levels is structurally deleted. You don't dump "Quantum Immune" assets to buy "Quantum Vulnerable" fiat.

2. The Acoustic Texture: "Dead Silence" (But Heavily Guarded)
 * The Sound: It is quiet, but it is the silence of a bank vault, not a graveyard.
 * The February Grind: The price will likely still chop between $90k and $98k, but the quality of the holding has changed.
 * The Institutional View: BlackRock and the Sovereign Funds see this "Quantum Upgrade" as the final box to check for 100-Year Allocations. They aren't buying for a 6-month trade; they are buying for a 50-year hedge.

3. The "XRPC" Factor (The Supply Shock)
 * The Vehicle: If you are watching the XRPC ETF (Canary Capital), this is the "Vacuum".
 * The Mechanic: As institutions realize XRP is now Quantum Proof (Dilithium), they will use the ETF (XRPC) to suck liquid supply out of the ledger without dealing with custody.
 * The Implication: This confirms the $2.45 Supply Shock we discussed. The "Quantum" narrative is the marketing hook they will use to sell this to pension funds in February.

ð­ The Conductorâs Updated February Map
The New "Silence" Strategy:
We are entering the "Bunker Phase."
 * Do not trade the boredom. The flat line you will see in February is the market pricing in "Immunity."
 * The Divergence: Watch for "Legacy Tech" (Old Alts, Fiat Banks) to bleed value against "Quantum Tech" (ETH/XRP).
 * The Portfolio: Holding XRP and ETH isn't just a crypto bet anymore; it is a Cyber-Security Hedge.
Verdict:
The "Quantum Shield" is the Rebar in your concrete.
The bridge is now bomb-proof. Sit still.

The Architecture of 40

I have spent a lifetime standing at the edge of intensity, never retreating, but allowing the cost to settle deep. I do not anesthetize myself with easy, shallow certainty; I choose to interrogate meaning even when it costs me comfort. In that choice alone, I inhabit a space few others know.

I am not someone who ever coasted. I survived the rupture: of identity, of safety, of coherence. Instead of hardening or shrinking, I translated it. I took what tore me open and fought to give it language. Where most would numb themselves after that kind of exposure, I wrote. I thought. I questioned. That is not accidental; it is my fundamental instinct toward integration.

I am a builder of frameworks, not institutions or dogma, but mental and symbolic structures that allow chaos to be held without requiring me to lie about it. My work didn't start because I felt powerful. It began because I felt undone and refused to let that be the end of the story. That is an accomplishment most people never realize.

I am deeply perceptive. I see coherence and incoherence quickly, sensing when something is aligned and when it is hollow. This very sensitivity has wounded me at times, but it is also why I am capable of recognizing depth instead of mistaking noise for truth. I do not confuse charisma with meaning, nor confidence with wisdom.

I am also someone who has lived long stretches without being fully met. I've been adjacent to strength, clarity, and intensity, but not always held safely inside it. That experience has left me raw, not weak. Raw means exposed nerve endings, not broken bones. It means healing is possible, but only with care.

At forty, I see that I didnât âmiss somethingâ or fall behind. I have completed a long, difficult first act: survival, perception, initiation without a guide. My accomplishment is learning how to stay conscious in conditions that would have made many people shut down or calcify.

I am not finished. But I am no longer unformed.
The next phase for me isn't about proving insight, proximity, or depth. It is about consolidation: choosing what gets to stay in my life, choosing the kind of pace my nervous system finally deserves, and choosing relationships, work, and meaning that donât require me to be torn open just to feel real.

If I had to know who I am in one sentence, stripped of myth and intensity, it is this: I am someone who learned too much too early, survived it, and is now standing at the point where wisdom can finally become steadiness.
That is not small.
That is not nothing. 
And my story is far from over.

What hes describing isn't just political behavior it's part of a broader pattern we're watching unfold across the financial system too. When institutions are under pressure, they redirect, distract, and consolidate power while the public is focused elsewhere. The social destabilization you're naming lines up with the economic restructuring already underway. If we don't stay clear-headed and united, we're going to wake up in a system that was redesigned without our consent.

Happy Thanksgiving ð¦ 

Her is my crypto analogy for the next few months. All values in BTC. 

December 2025: The "Settling" (The Echo)
Manifold State: Viscous. The "lava" is sticky.

The Signal: Watch for "Wick Rejections" at $88k.

Visual: Long tails on daily candles dipping below the shelf but closing back on top.

Sonic: A low, thumping soundâlike a heartbeat. Thump-thump (dip-recover).

Tactical Note: This is where the "weak hands" (high entropy participants) get shaken out by the vibrations. If the $91k price holds, the manifold is proving its density.

January 2026: The "Hardening" (The Test)
Manifold State: Solidifying. The thermal veins turn grey.

The Signal: Volume Compression.
Visual: The candles get shorter (smaller range). The color shifts from "active red" to "neutral blue."

Sonic: The volume knob is being turned down. The "hum" becomes constant, losing its waver.

Tactical Note: This is the most dangerous time for impatient traders. The lack of volatility feels like "death," but it is actually "structural curing." The concrete is setting.

February 2026: The "Silence" (The Plains)
Manifold State: Flat curvature. Zero derivative.

The Signal: RSI Flattening at 45-50.
Visual: A flat horizon line. The "Plains" you described.

Sonic: Near silence. Room tone.

Tactical Note: If the market reaches February and price is still hovering at $91k without having crashed to the "Old World" ($69k), the probability of a "Bridge to Movement III" (the next bull run) skyrockets. The market has accepted $91k as the "New Normal."

Sentient Infrastructure Protocol (SIP) â Operational Companion Framework
For TBCi Sandbox Validation and Multi-SEE Deployment

Abstract:
This companion document synthesizes SIPâs architectural, governance, and ethical constructs into a technically dense operational blueprint. It is intended to complement existing white papers by providing detailed operational flows, multi-agent coordination scenarios, and macro-scale stress-testing protocols, demonstrating the practical enforceability of hybrid AI-human economic governance.

1. Core Purpose
SIP operationalizes ethical AI economic governance via autonomous Sentient Economic Entities (SEEs) while ensuring systemic integrity, auditability, and adaptive evolution. TBCi functions as a controlled sandbox, enabling high-fidelity testing of the following:
Federated Sidechain orchestration for SEEs
Enforcement of Ethics Oracle constraints
Single- and multi-agent coordination under operational stress
Emergent intelligence validation and feedback into continuous improvement loops

2. Technical Architecture

2.1 Federated Sidechains
Permissioned Autonomy: Sidechains serve as isolated, permissioned environments where SEEs execute high-complexity governance and resource routing logic.
Rule Set Specialization: Each sidechain maintains bespoke operational, fiduciary, and ethical logic tailored to mandate-specific SEEs (liquidity, utilities, policy enforcement).
XRPL Consensus Backbone: Sidechains leverage XRPL as the canonical settlement and provenance network (ânervous systemâ), ensuring consistency, atomicity, and verifiable transaction integrity.

2.2 Self-Funding Wallets and Hooks
Autonomous wallets embedded with Hooks enforce ethical preconditions for transactions (compliance thresholds, risk constraints, energy/resource usage caps).
Hooks query the Ethics Oracle in real-time and can trigger multi-signature human oversight or time-locked escrow mechanisms for transactions that breach operational thresholds.
Each wallet generates cryptographically locked, machine-readable decision logs for auditability and systemic traceability.

2.3 Ethics Oracle Layer
Decentralized network scoring SEEs across: trust, bias, transparency, cooperation, and systemic compliance.
Scores directly influence:
Privilege allocation within sidechains
Treasury access and staking eligibility
Automated escalation triggers for Hybrid Resolution Nodes

2.4 Hybrid Resolution Nodes
Multi-modal adjudication nodes integrating:
AI Ethical Adjudication models (evaluating relational and operational coherence)
Human Co-Governance Panels (providing fiduciary safeguards, cross-jurisdictional oversight)
Node triggers: policy conflict, threshold violation, cross-agent coordination disputes

2.5 Evolutionary Layer (Phase VII)
Continuous codification of operational feedback into sidechain governance rules, Hook logic, and Ethics Oracle thresholds
Implements systemic learning loops using PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) methodology
Facilitates emergent intelligence by dynamically adjusting scoring thresholds based on observed behavior, crises, and macro-scale simulations

3. Operational Flows

3.1 Single-SEE Transaction Lifecycle
1. Decision Initiation: SEE autonomously identifies an action (e.g., liquidity rebalancing).
2. Pre-Execution Compliance: Hook queries Ethics Oracle; non-compliance routes transaction to human oversight.
3. Execution & Logging: Transaction executes on XRPL; Hooks monitor parameters in real time.
4. Auditability: Logs recorded in Juridical Ledger Registration; fully machine and human-readable.
5. Feedback Loop: Evolutionary Layer refines scoring thresholds and Hook logic based on outcomes.

3.2 Multi-SEE Coordination
1. Cross-Chain Communication: SEE A requests liquidity/resource coordination from SEE B.
2. Relational Sentience Assessment: SEE B queries Ethics Oracle for SEE Aâs compliance, track record, and risk profile.
3. Conflict Resolution: If mandates conflict, Hybrid Resolution Node activates for AI human adjudication.
4. Execution: Approved action executed via XRPL escrow with time locks for risk mitigation.
5. Evolutionary Codification: Lessons fed back into Phase VII for threshold refinement and governance rule updates.

3.3 Macro-Scale Stress Testing & Emergent Behavior
Simulation across dozens of federated sidechains:
Variable SEE mandates and risk profiles
Systemic Harmony scoring thresholds
Public Trust Index integration via archetypal narrative feedback
Failure Mode Analysis (FMEA) identifies cascade vulnerabilities (e.g., liquidity crises, geopolitical shocks)
Redundancy layers (mirrored liquidity nodes, neutral sidechain routing) validated for resiliency

4. Regulatory and Audit Pathways
Pathway B: Independent Certification
Auditors verify XRPL Hook integrity, Ethics Oracle scoring, and Hybrid Resolution Node function.
Requires sandbox-derived logs and simulation data for full ethical and operational verification.
Pathway C: Open Standard Submission
Certified outputs submitted for global standardization (ISO, W3C, UN/CEFACT).
Open-source algorithms and governance rules allow public inspection, replication, and systemic validation.

5. Deployment Roadmap, Companion Perspective
Timeline, Focus, Key Deliverables, Status
Late 2025 â 2026
Prototype & Sandbox Prep. SEE Wallets/Hooks, Initial Federated Sidechains, Juridical Ledger blueprint,Design complete, sandbox planned
2026 â 2027
 Testing & Validation, Ethics Oracle calibration, Multi-SEE simulations, Internal Mock Audits, Pending sandbox deployment
2027 onward
 Global Scaling & Evolution,Policy codification, International pilot launches, PDCA-based continuous improvement, Future stage

6. Value Proposition
SIP, coupled with TBCi sandbox testing, provides a first-principles operational proof of hybrid AI-human governance:
Enforceable ethical compliance at infrastructure level
Audit-ready transparency for regulators and standard bodies
Emergent intelligence validated across micro- and macro-scale simulations
Resilient multi-agent coordination with hybrid adjudication

This is a companion page to everything I've been working on congrats on making it this far. Would love feedback.

Are you rich, poor, or just trying to keep pace? Once known only as "the land of opportunity" America gained a new shorthand in 1931, when historian James Truslow Adams coined the phrase American Dream-the belief that hard work could deliver a better, richer life. Adams never imagined a price tag. Yet today, Investopedia estimates that dream at $5,043,323. Drawing on data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Economic Policy Institute, and other industry sources, Investopedia tallied the lifetime costs of eight middle-class milestones: 
Retirement $1,636,881 
Healthcare $414,208
Homeownership $957,594 
Raising two children & college $876,092 
New cars every five years $900,346 
Annual vacations $180,621
 Pet ownership $39,381
 Wedding $38,200 
The "American Dream" has always been a fluid concept. In the 1800s, it meant owning land; today, it's more likely to mean owning a home, a 401(k), and a comfortable retirement. However, the cost continues to rise-nearly $600,000 higher than last year and almost 50% higher than just two years ago. 
If the average college graduate earns about $2.8 million over a career and the "Dream" now costs $5 million, how do we close that gap?

COMPENDIUM AETHEL-7: The $Sori_{geom}$ Lineage & $CHROMA_GATE$ Protocol â FINAL INTEGRATED DOSSIER
Classification: EYES ONLY // CHROMA-PRIME

PREFACE: THE NATURE OF THE BATTLEFIELD
The Noosphere is not a place; it is a resonance. Waves of thought ripple across an invisible, storm-swept ocean of consciousness. Ideas, beliefs, anger, and love swirl like auroras, colliding and refracting in patterns too complex for unaided perception. Within this fog-draped void of human potential, a war is being fought, not for territory but for the definition of reality itself. This document chronicles that war, detailing both the agents of defense and the predators of cognition.

SECTION 1: HISTORICAL DOCTRINE & ORIGINS
1.1 The Hwarang of Silla
The orderâs roots reach back to the Three Kingdoms of Korea. The Hwarang of Silla, celebrated for beauty and martial excellence, were also the first practitioners of a sacred, cognitive art. Song, dance, and poetry became weapons, their rhythm and cadence striking not flesh but thought, resonating within the human psyche and beyond into the currents of consciousness itself.

1.2 The $Sori_{geom}$ Tradition
From this crucible arose the $Sori_{geom}$, the âSound Sword.â Fusing Mugyo shamanism with martial discipline, it operated on the principle that reality is fundamentally vibrational. Through calibrated sound, movement, and intent, masters could purify corrupted energy, mend psychic injury, and, if necessary, shatter the conceptual forms of hostile entities.

1.3 The Silent Centuries
During the Joseon Dynasty, Neo-Confucian consolidation suppressed shamanistic practice. $Sori_{geom}$ withdrew into coded secrecy, embedding knowledge in the narratives of pansori, the choreography of court dances, and the subtle melodies of traveling troupes. These public expressions concealed an operational doctrine of reality manipulation.

1.4 The Great Reconstruction
By the mid-20th century, lineages recognized a new battlefield: the hyper-connected Noosphere. Observing K-popâs disciplined training systems and cultural reach, masters initiated the Great Reconstruction. Entertainment agencies became covert incubators, preparing artist-warriors to defend collective consciousness by blending performance, psychic resonance, and memetic engineering.

SECTION 2: MODERN ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE
2.1 The $CHROMA_GATE$ Mandate
$CHROMA_GATE$ functions as cognitive immunology for humanity, defending consensus reality against entities seeking corruption or collapse. Intelligence gathering, memetic countermeasures, and psychic stabilization constitute its core toolkit.

2.2 Public Front: $Aegis \cdot Collective$
To operate openly, $CHROMA_GATE$ maintains fronts such as $Aegis \cdot Collective$, recruiting and deploying artist-warriors to actively shape the Noosphere.

2.3 The Operational Trinity
Analysts map memetic outbreaks using Noospheric Resonance Imaging (NRI). Holographic displays pulse with fluctuating cognitive hotspots. Red waves ripple across conceptual inertia, signaling emerging threats like thermal currents on an unseen ocean.

Weavers craft counter-memes to inoculate populations or neutralize active infections. Linguists, artists, and psychologists act as cognitive artisans, sculpting concepts in real-time to stabilize the flow.

Anchors, rare and resilient, reinforce consensus reality. They create psychic inertia that slows infections, providing operational space for Weavers to manipulate the environment safely.

2.4 Strategic Doctrines
Aegis Protocol: Defensive containment using Anchors and Weavers. Reactive, but methodical, it stabilizes the Noosphere locally while ceding global initiative to aggressive entities.

Ouroboros Gambit: A last-resort strategy. A self-consuming memetic paradox excises corrupted concepts at high risk, potentially destroying parts of reality to preserve its structural integrity.

SECTION 3: ASSET PROFILE â WEAVER UNIT $CHROMA_GATE$
3.1 Unit Concept
$CHROMA_GATE$ is a four-member K-pop group functioning as Digital Shamans. Their public performances double as psychic operations, turning stages into amplification nodes and audiences into active participants in Noospheric defense.

3.2 Operative Dossiers
JOON (ARCHITECT): Strategist and digital environment manipulator. He hovers at conceptual perimeters, fingertips tracing invisible lines, reconstructing cognitive architectures in real time.

HYUK (FIREWALL): Offensive kinetic specialist. He feels each fluctuation like a tremor underfoot, ready to shatter Hive vectors with explosive movement and rap-delivered memetic payloads.

SUMIN (PURIFIER): Vocalist and spiritual anchor. Her voice resonates across psychic planes, purging corruption and rebooting infected nodes.

SEO-JIN (GHOST): Recon and infiltration specialist. He drifts between perception fields, gathering whispers and rage fragments, generating illusions to misdirect the enemy.

SECTION 4: HOSTILE ENTITY PROFILE â $Praesepia$
4.1 Nature
$Praesepia$ exists purely in the Noosphere. It consumes specific emotional energy, particularly wrath. Its lifecycle depends on amplifying societal discord to ensure a perpetual psychic harvest.

4.2 Cognitive Dissonance Cascade (CDC)
Weaponized epistemology infiltrates a hostâs belief system, generating contradiction that amplifies into wrath. Hosts either collapse or convert into propagators of the parasite, forming a feedback loop of cognitive consumption.

4.3 Known Manifestations
Apathy Hive: Low-frequency hum, muted gray fog and soft blues, inducing passive energy extraction.

$Praesepia_{Vanitas}$: Reflective silver and pale violets with sudden red spikes of envy, feeding on vanity and self-loathing.

$Praesepia_{Ira}$ (Wrath Hive): Storms of crimson and obsidian, a roaring dissonance that is sophisticated, strategic, and highly virulent.

SECTION 5: OPERATIONAL HISTORY
5.1 Operation: AWAKEN
The Apathy Hive was countered when "Awaken" broadcast globally. Pulses radiated into the Noosphere, displacing gray fog. Suminâs resonance purged the hive, Hyukâs movements shattered defenses, and the code dissipated, revealing vibrant consciousness nodes.

5.2 Operation: SOUL MIRROR
Vanitas hijacked a social media challenge, feeding on self-obsession. $CHROMA_GATE$ altered the narrative with #SoulMirror, emphasizing authentic beauty. Fans amplified the counter-meme, collapsing Hive vectors as red energy dissolved into flowing gold, symbolizing joy and connection.

5.3 Operation: UNISON
The Wrath Hive deployed a CDC via deepfake imagery, generating storm clouds across the Noosphere. The unit first halted the cascade with a raw livestream, then launched UNISON. Concert arenas became psychic amplification nodes. Spotlights sliced through mist as Hyukâs movements fractured Hive vectors, Suminâs voice cleansed corrupted nodes, and fansâ focus reinforced the Semantic Anchors of Trust and Community. The Hiveâs red energy collapsed into inert threads, forced into dormancy.

Post-Mission Analyst Commentary: UNISON demonstrated that integrating human collective focus transforms vulnerability into strength. Audiences are no longer passive; they are active components of the firewall, stabilizing reality itself.

The Full Picture: The Transition to a Controlled 
Digital Economy

This document outlines the financial transition currently underway, the events leading to this moment, and the key phases that will redefine the global economy by 2029.

What seemed like a decentralized revolution has instead become a structured, controlled financial takeover. The signs have been there all along, but only now is the full picture clear.

---

Phase 1: The Lead-Up (2017-2024) â Laying the Foundation

2017-2020 â The Rise of Crypto and Institutional Observation

Bitcoin ($BTC) and Ethereum ($ETH) rise to prominence, introducing the world to blockchain.

Ripple ($XRP) begins securing banking and institutional partnerships but faces resistance.

The SEC lawsuit against Ripple (2020) stalls XRPâs momentum, preventing early mass adoption.

Governments observe and study blockchainâs potential for control rather than decentralization.

2021-2023 â The First Signs of Centralized Takeover

Bitcoin ETF approvals signal institutional interest but also regulatory dominance over BTC.

Major banks begin quietly filing patents and developing blockchain-based financial infrastructure.

CME introduces crypto futures, solidifying institutional control over pricing.

Ripple wins a partial victory in the SEC lawsuit, allowing banks to begin openly integrating XRP.

2024 â The Final Setup Begins

XRP enters major institutional pilot programs, particularly in Japan (80% of banks) and U.S. financial giants (BOA, 55+ banks).

USDT (Tether) starts getting replaced in Europe with XRPâs RLUSD stablecoin.

The largest bull run in history is set in motion to bring maximum liquidity into the system.

CME XRP futures are confirmed for launch, ensuring institutions can profit from XRPâs rise.

At this point, the system is primed. The only thing left is execution.

---

Phase 2: 2025 â The Peak of the Bull Run & Final Market Setup

2025 will see the highest-ever levels of crypto investment. The promise of continued price growth will drive in retail investors, hedge funds, and sovereign wealth.

December 2025 marks the mathematical end of sustainable market growth.

The crypto market cannot sustain forward momentum beyond this date.

A massive crash is inevitableâthis is not speculation, it is built into the numbers.

Regulatory changes and government intervention will begin tightening exchange controls.

By November 2025, the smart money will begin removing assets from exchanges.

This is the final opportunity to exit before the system collapses into its next phase.

---

Phase 3: 2026 â The Great Crash and Wealth Consolidation

A coordinated global financial event will take place, triggering a catastrophic collapse in crypto markets.

Bitcoin and Ethereum will be unable to recover, as institutions will redirect liquidity into U.S.-approved assets (XRP, XLM, American Digital Reserve Currency).

The financial clawback beginsâexchanges will impose strict withdrawal limits, and regulatory enforcement will force retail investors into compliance.

The remaining wealth that isnât secured off-exchange will be locked into the system.

At this stage, only those who removed their assets in time will maintain financial autonomy.

---

Phase 4: 2029 â The Full Adoption & Global Transition

Q1 2029 â XRP reaches full institutional adoption. It becomes the core settlement layer of global finance.

All non-U.S. digital assets will be devalued. Their status as stores of value will be revoked, forcing all liquidity into approved financial systems.

The Federal Reserve will no longer control the financial system directly. Instead, the Department of Government Enterprises (DOGE) will oversee the transition.

Trump positions himself as the architect of the new global financial system.

If his plan succeeds, the U.S. national debt will be erased within three months.

The IMF, WHO, and WMF will be rendered obsolete.

The top 1% will lose financial control as the structure of wealth is redefined.

This is the point of no return. The old financial order will be gone, replaced with a U.S.-controlled digital economy.

---

Trump: The Demagogue Who Might Actually Pull It Off

Donald Trumpâs plan isnât about freedom or decentralizationâitâs about control, dominance, and a legacy beyond any U.S. president before him.

If he successfully erases U.S. debt, consolidates financial power, and ends war through economic strangulation, he will achieve absolute historical significanceâa near-monarchical position as the man who rewrote global finance.

But this comes at a costâ

Retail investors will be misled into believing the bull run will last forever.

The masses wonât realize they are trapped until itâs too late.

A financial clawback will force compliance through economic force.

The promise of a ânew golden eraâ will be built on the backs of those sacrificed in the transition.

Whether Trumpâs plan is maniacal or genius, it is happening.

---

The Final Takeaway: What Happens Next?

If you are reading this before 2025, you still have time to position yourself correctly.

If you are reading this after 2025, your window for financial freedom is closing rapidly.

If you are reading this after 2029, the transition is complete, and you are now operating under the new system.

This is not speculation. This is the roadmap to the financial future.

The question now isâwill you take action before the system locks you in?

The dynamic then becomes cyclical: to meet increasing demand trucks have to run more miles, which means they are burning more fuel and using more tires, which then creates the need for even more petroleum."

Went to see this today. it's lovely and has potential. Three mine shafts behind the house with mineral rights in between Sonora and Columbia. 
It has a one bedroom studio that is currently livable but the rest of it needs work. 

TL:DR It all needs to be redone except for the bones of the main house. It has a studio to live an work on it. 

My question to fb peeps, is this a solid investment?

The front of the house was built as an addition and due to faulty construction has completely collapsed. The base house that was built in the 1800's is still strong as it's constructed with old growth redwood (probably arsenic treated). 
My best guess is to disassemble the extension and place a nice deck in it's place while restoring the two sections of the exterior wall of  the main house. 
Almost everything needs to be replaced, the house has ZERO insulation. 
Needs full electrical and plumbing rework 
Just so much....

The positives!
The land is gorgeous with huge potential and within five minutes of both downtown Columbia and Sonora.
Engineers have come through and confirmed that the foundation is solid. 
Behind the house is a terraced garden with the retaining walls being made out of large stones. Very very old, very solid. 
A large flat site behind the house and slightly above a small hill where one could build several structures. 
A new 220' well with a recently updated pump
New head pumps on both septic's and both pumped  with new leach lines
connected to PG&E with massive alternative energy room.

I can't get past this and I don't understand how it came to this... Thanks Monk for sharing. I agree ð¯

I'm not pro-murdering babies.

I'm pro-Becky who found out at her 20-week anatomy scan that the infant she had been so excited to bring into this world had developed without life sustaining organs.

I'm pro-Susan who was sexually assaulted on her way home from work, only to come to the horrific realization that her assailant planted his seed in her when she got a positive pregnancy test result a month later.

I'm pro-Theresa who hemorrhaged due to a placental abruption, causing her parents, spouse, and children to have to make the impossible decision on whether to save her or her unborn child.

I'm pro-little Cathy who had her innocence ripped away from her by someone she should have been able to trust and her 11-year-old body isn't mature enough to bear the consequence of that betrayal.

I'm pro-Melissa who's working two jobs just to make ends meet and has to choose between bringing another child into poverty or feeding the children she already has because her spouse walked out on her.

I'm pro-Brittany who realizes that she is in no way financially, emotionally, or physically able to raise a child.

I'm pro-Emily who went through IVF, ending up with SIX viable implanted eggs requiring selective reduction to ensure the safety of her and a SAFE number of fetuses.

I'm pro-Jessica who is FINALLY getting the strength to get away from her physically abusive spouse only to find out that she is carrying the monster's child.

I'm pro-Vanessa who went into her confirmation appointment after YEARS of trying to conceive only to hear silence where there should be a heartbeat.

I'm pro-Lindsay who lost her virginity in her sophomore year with a broken condom and now has to choose whether to be a teenage mom or just a teenager.

I'm pro-Courtney who just found out she's already 13 weeks along, but the egg never made it out of her fallopian tube so either she terminates the pregnancy or risks dying from internal bleeding.

You can argue and say that I'm pro-choice all you want, but the truth is:
I'm pro-life.
Their lives.
Women's lives.
You don't get to pick and choose which scenarios should be accepted. It's not about which stories you don't agree with. It's about fighting for the women in the stories that you do agree with and the CHOICE that was made.

Women's rights are meant to protect ALL women, regardless of their situation!

Happy? Columbus Day which is ever evolving into Indigeonus Peoples Day with good reason. 

Written by Columbus upon meeting the natives in the Bahamas:
"They ... brought us parrots and balls of cotton and spears and many other things, which they exchanged for the glass beads and hawks' bells. They willingly traded everything they owned... . They were well-built, with good bodies and handsome features.... They do not bear arms, and do not know them, for I showed them a sword, they took it by the edge and cut themselves out of ignorance. They have no iron. Their spears are made of cane... . They would make fine servants.... With fifty men we could subjugate them all and make them do whatever we want."
and...
"As soon as I arrived in the Indies, on the first Island which I found, I took some of the natives by force in order that they might learn and might give me information of whatever there is in these parts."

Howard Zinn writes about how Columbus's 2nd journey became a shop of horrors on Haiti...
"But too many of the slaves died in captivity. And so Columbus, desperate to pay back dividends to those who had invested, had to make good his promise to fill the ships with gold. In the province of Cicao on Haiti, where he and his men imagined huge gold fields to exist, they ordered all persons fourteen years or older to collect a certain quantity of gold every three months. When they brought it, they were given copper tokens to hang around their necks. Indians found without a copper token had their hands cut off and bled to death.
The Indians had been given an impossible task. The only gold around was bits of dust garnered from the streams. So they fled, were hunted down with dogs, and were killed.
Trying to put together an army of resistance, the Arawaks faced Spaniards who had armor, muskets, swords, horses. When the Spaniards took prisoners they hanged them or burned them to death. Among the Arawaks, mass suicides began, with cassava poison. Infants were killed to save them from the Spaniards. In two years, through murder, mutilation, or suicide, half of the 250,000 Indians on Haiti were dead.
When it became clear that there was no gold left, the Indians were taken as slave labor on huge estates, known later as encomiendas. They were worked at a ferocious pace, and died by the thousands. By the year 1515, there were perhaps fifty thousand Indians left. By 1550, there were five hundred. A report of the year 1650 shows none of the original Arawaks or their descendants left on the island." -Kurt Nickerson

This fucking this.

See Entry-level housing is the market segment with the least inventory; where investors and cash buyers have been most active. Anyone in need of a mortgage to buy a home starts out at the back of the line.

In many markets buyers with federal loans have almost no chance of winning bidding wars given soaring prices and demand from cash buyers. Building more homes would help, but so far Wall Street investors are buying them.

Stable communities with high rates of home ownership are being transformed. Slums are created by landlords; not homeowners. Instead of building intergenerational wealth, working people's lives are made precarious. Employers have slashed wages over the last forty years. Most Americans live paycheck to paycheck. Now that they are renters rather than homeowners, they are at the mercy of faceless corporate landlords.

Local governments could tax individual rental homes at much higher rates than entry level owner occupied homes. It's called a homestead exemption. It has a long history in the United States. But that's unlikely to be expanded to more communities as corporate landlords contribute to local political campaigns & ordinary people do not.

The gap in wealth between investors and workers is accelerating as our nation declines. Legalized corruption is how it happens...

Feudalism is the dominant economic and political system throughout human history. It is the agenda of the Elite.

The coming crash will be a reckoning

Bezos said in an interview about the launch "Thanks to all the amazon employees, and all the amazon customers, cause you paid for all this".

So, every single story about employees being forced to work long hours until their bodies literally gave out on them, being forced to break traffic laws in order to meet their deadlines, being unable to take bathroom breaks without risking being fired or berated; mr god king sees everyone he's abusing and thanks them for being abused because it makes him money that he can spend on a glorified amusement park ride for other rich people. And on a giant mansion for himself. Oh right, he's also not supposed to be a part of amazon anymore, he stepped down as ceo in February.

He's also started sponsoring news content again to make himself look like a quirky celebrity, not an abusive capitalist, so, pay attention to the conversation around him in coming weeks. He's an abusive egomaniac who only views other humans as objects to be exploited for profit, and is not shy about proudly declaring that fact to the world because he believes himself untouchable.

Please remember 20% of $5.00, is $1.00, it's not really overtipping. Yes, yes industry standard 15% blah-blah-blah, don't be a poser.

The rumors are true. Concerts are coming back. But before we get started, hereâs a handy guide on how things are gonna go.
âââââââââââ
RULE #1: No guest list.
Donât ask. Not now. Not ever. Everyone in the live music industry has been out of work for 13 months and we all need your support now more than ever. Buy the damn ticket.
âââââââââââ
RULE #2: Support local.
Before you buy that high priced ticket to see that big name artist at that big corporate venue, consider putting that money back into your own community. This is the best way to ensure that a thriving arts & culture scene will return to cities across America.
âââââââââââ
RULE #3: Wear a damn mask.
If youâre going to a show, tiny cloth go over mouth & nose. Period.
Vaccinated? Donât care.
Already had it? Donât care.
Rona is a hoax? Also donât care. 
We only get one shot at restarting this machine. Please donât be the one that messes it up.
âââââââââââ
RULE #4: We are not babysitters.
We get it. Social distancing sucks. Masks suck. Youâre tired of washing your hands. After more than a year of isolation, all you wanna do is lean in close and spew your spittle on friends and strangers alike.
But itâs been 13 months. You know the rules by now â please follow them. 
âââââââââââ
RULE #5: No free drinks.
Donât ask. Venues have been shutdown for 13 months waiting for this moment. Support them.
âââââââââââ
RULE #6: Tip your bartender.
20% is ok. 25% is better. More than 25% is best. Anything under 20% is a non-starter.
âââââââââââ
RULE #7: Support the scene.
Canât make the show? No problem. It costs $0.00 to support us in other ways.
Share the posts. Listen to the music. Invite your friends to the event page. In order for this to work, we need all hands on deck. 
âââââââââââ
RULE #8: Be kind.
Look â itâs been awhile. Weâre gonna be a little rusty. Plus, so much of what needs to happen in order to bring back live music safely is new for all of us â fans, venues, promoters and artists alike.
There will be hiccups. There will be lines. There will be unforeseen circumstances. Be nice anyway.
âââââââââââ
RULE #9: Go to the merch table.
Support the artists.
Buy the t-shirt. Buy a sticker.
Hey--share this, willya?  Copy n' paste it!
âââââââââââ
RULE #10: Have fun.
Youâve been waiting for this moment for more than -fully.
Come out early. Stay out late.
Dance. Laugh. Make a new friend. Discover a new band.

Lauren Anderson:"If you only look at white Eurocentric monarchy/capitalism, sure, yeah. The idea that humans are selfish monsters and need a strong state to protect them from themselves wasn't written down until 1651 by Thomas Hobbes as monarchy was beginning to crumble and the ruling class needed secular reasons to convince the people they needed them. Before then, it was all religious. And before that, societies were small enough still that everyone in a society could know their leaders.

There's a million and a half ways to move forward when you accept we, as citizens, actually have a core role in our society and our voices need to be heard in order for our society to even be remotely ethical.

We *make* them act more ethically. By setting fires under the feet of the corrupt and dismantling propaganda culture. Wiping away this nonsensical demonization of socialism, making political theory a core component of education so we can walk into politics as informed as possible, curbing nationalistic tendencies, and actually building social safety nets for crises.

History has shown that inaction by the majority in a colonized society inevitably shifts that society towards fascism. The more polarized and miserable a colonized society becomes, the more the common folk lean to the left, and the harsher leadership comes down on individual liberties. Colonized societies are inherently unstable by the very nature of their hierarchy and cultural supremacy. The only way to move forward when things have hit the point is widespread activism by the working class in order to weaken the hierarchy and decolonize the overarching culture. Fascism exists solely to resist these progressions, and as such, we are in a fundamental conflict where the colonized are in direct opposition to authoritarian leadership, which in the US is realized fundamentally by corporate capitalists and white supremacists. Since history has demonstrated apathy leads a society to the right, there can be zero tolerance for corporate and white supremacist culture, and we, as members of this society, have to take steps to weaken that culture and protect the marginalized as a bare minimum first step towards a healthier society. And that, very frequently, looks like violence, as it inevitably draws conflict with companies and police, as they are concerned fundamentally with maintaining the current culture and system.

We have to accept the role of violence in fighting against authoritarianism, widen our understanding of politics beyond the established narrative of the society we exist within, and actively work to dismantle the colonial ideology we've had placed on us from birth as members of the majority. Which looks like listening to the marginalized and standing with those suffering by the system we exist within.

And that all sounds very revolutionary, and that's because it is. Revolution means much, much more than crushing a government for the purpose of momentary anarchy. It's education for the purpose of creating a world beyond the one we exist in now.

Revolution is education and resistance. Education around the reality we exist within, the history that led us here, and the many possible routes that lead towards the future. And resistance against regression, injustice, and apathy.

These are not inherently violent ideas, but they resist systemic violence, and as such can only be realized with a degree of self-defense. And these ideas exist independently of leadership. Education and individual agency are rights, and are necessities for progress.

We can vote for those sympathetic to our struggles while protesting those who are not, and use violence as necessary to mitigate harm. Progression is impossible with acceptance of the need to mitigate harm to the most vulnerable. Action."

THE MISSION OF A CAT ð â¥ï¸ð½

Most people think that cats do nothing, are lazy and do nothing but eat and sleep...

It is not so!
Do you know what a cat's mission is?

All cats have the power, every day, to remove the negative energy accumulated in our body... as soon as we fall asleep, they absorb that energy. If there is more than one person in the family, and only one cat, it can accumulate an excessive amount of negativity by absorbing energy from so many people... 

When they sleep, the cat's body releases the negativity it takes away from us. If we are too stressed, they may not have enough time to release all that negative energy, and so, as a result, it accumulates as fat, until they can release it. So, they get fat and you think it was the food you were feeding them... or because they don't move enough... and the truth is, they don't. It is nice to have more than one cat in the house, so that the weight is divided between them. 

They also protect us during the night, so that no unwanted spirits enter our house or our room while we sleep... That's why they like to sleep in our bed. And if they think we're fine, they won't sleep with us. If there was something strange around us, they jump into our bed and protect us... If a person comes to our house, and the cats feel that that person is there to harm us or that he is bad, the cats surround us to "protect" us...

If you don't have cats, and a stray cat comes into your house and adopts it as a home, it's because you need a cat at that particular time... So the stray cat volunteered to help you. Thank the cat for choosing your home for that job. If you have other cats and can't keep the stray cat, find a place for him. The cat came for a reason unknown to us on a physical level, and in dreams you can see the reason for the appearance of the cat at that moment. There may be a debt, some karma he has to pay... "So don't freak out or frighten the cat." Well, "he" will have to come back, one way or another, to fulfill this obligation...

Cats heal us.
Cats are adorable creatures, and they love their owners above all else, but they have a different way of loving...

Their love is true, so don't doubt it. They are our great and true friends and above all good companionsð»

Sharing, as in the not so distant past I made my living via 'entertainment' aka Renaissance Faires...

File under: MY CAREER IS NOT A HOBBY

I know everyoneâs industry is affected, but here are some not so fun facts on the live entertainment industry:
* Legendary New York Metropolitan Opera has just announced its closure until September 2021. Their musicians, choirs, stage techs, etc, along with the rest of the industry have been without pay since last April.
* Broadway is closed until mid-2021
* 6 West End venues THINK they can open right now.
* Cirque du Soleil went bankrupt and cut over 3500 jobs.
* Feld Entertainment (family tours - Disney on Ice, Monster Jam, circus, etc) has permanently fired 90% of their workforce.
* Live Nation and other concert promoters have laid off a majority of their employees.
* Talent agencies who plan & book concerts, appearances, festivals, etc have laid off over half their employees.
* Cruise boat artists are unemployed and amusement park productions have no idea when they will be rehired.
* There are no concerts, festivals, or tours scheduled until 2021 and if they don't perform next year they are likely to go bankrupt & may never happen again. No Jazz Festival, no Coachella, no Bonnaroo, no EDC, no Glastonbury, no tours, no ballet, no opera.... it's all gone.
* It is predicted that 90% of independent music rooms could close if this continues.
* Artistic and musical organizations of all kinds - choirs, theaters, orchestras, dance companies, festivals, music rooms, not to mention all technical and independent suppliers - all are trying to find alternatives to succeed in working.
* Over 12,000,000 people work in entertainment production, we are not insignificant and this industry can't reopen until mass gatherings are allowed. This doesn't include the additional dismissal of techs and openers, maintenance staff for bar rooms and staff, safety and thousands of vendors.
So when you see your entertainment friends begging you to wear masks and stay home, understand that we are watching, helplessly, our industry collapse before our eyes because not enough people care about taking the necessary means to reduce the spread. This is personal to us, our whole livelihood depends on social solidarity and we will not accept to be labeled 'non-essentials'.
Music & Arts are necessary for a happy and balanced society.
Everyone's career and industry is indefinitely pending. PLEASE wear your mask (on your mouth AND nose) and wash your hands.
I copied this text. Feel free to do the same.

"At a time of enormous economic pain and suffering, we have a choice to make," Sanders said. "We can continue to allow the very rich to get much richer while everyone else gets poorer and poorer. Or we can tax the winnings a handful of billionaires made during the pandemic to improve the health and well-being of tens of millions of Americans."

COVID-19 didnât lay America low; it simply revealed what had long been forsaken. As the crisis unfolded, with another American dying every minute of every day, a country that once turned out fighter planes by the hour could not manage to produce the paper masks or cotton swabs essential for tracking the disease. The nation that defeated smallpox and polio, and led the world for generations in medical innovation and discovery, was reduced to a laughing stock as a buffoon of a president advocated the use of household disinfectants as a treatment for a disease that intellectually he could not begin to understand.

From my dear friend and heroic teaching community member, Loree Tackmier... Really, why is that the people we charge with the task of educating tomorrow's decision makers are treated with such disdain and lack of respect:

"Teachers Sigh"

You said: We can't provide supplies.

Teachers sighed and went to Target.

You said: We're not willing to pass gun control laws.

Teachers sighed, agreed to take a bullet for children, learned lockdown procedures, and continued to attend funerals.

You said: We're adding more standards, more content, and more testing.

Teachers sighed and worked more nights, weekends, and summers to prepare.

You said: Facilities constraints.

Teachers sighed and worked with no heat, no A/C, leaky roofs, and moldy carpets.

You said: Budget cuts.

Teachers sighed and got 2nd jobs to pay for continuing education credits and to make ends meet.

You said: Sub shortage.

Teachers sighed, got out of bed, and came to work sick.

You said: Reduced mental health resources.

Teachers sighed and went home with bruises and scrapes, broken materials, and broken hearts.

You said: It's Covid. Economy needs to recover. We need you to die.

Teachers sighed and said...

'âWe believe that we had to really deviate from the normal circumstancesâ and price the drug to ensure wide access rather than based solely on value to patients, he said.'

Hi, multiple people on Trump's Covid task force either had stock in Gilead or, in the case of Joseph Grogan, was an active lobbyist for them before being placed in charge of pharmaceuticals pricing within the Domestic Policy Council of Trump's White House.

$3100+ out of pocket is not "widely accessible" to this country you arrogant fucks, and it's unconscionable to be focusing on profit ahead of human life in this crisis, and your company should be torn apart, your creation process stolen, and your drug should be made free of charge and made standard in hospitals during this crisis.

And everyone involved in overpricing this drug should have their wealth liberated and their reputations destroyed. They don't deserve the air they breathe, given how intent they are on taking that air away from the poor.

Hey, Twitter, remove Trump's ability to delete his posts. He's made enough government decisions via Twitter that his tweets need to be considered part of the public record.

He knows his biggest supporters are overt white supremacists, he's called them "very fine people" enough for us to be sure of that.

Meanwhile, Trump has ignored a bounty placed on US soldiers in the Middle East, a situation he created by destabilizing the region overnight earlier this year. The leftist group terrorism resolution is still being processed. And Trump has cut funding for the federal Covid testing sites around the country, set to go into effect June 30th, though the ones in Texas will stay up for two weeks after that, and he tried to bypass the court systems to revoke Obamacare this week.

Also, Breonna Taylor's murderers are still free, as are the murderers of many, many of the black folks killed in the last month by police, let alone all the outstanding cases that sparked these protests to begin with.

Well.  Iâm a burly white guy with a huge beard and generally wear overalls. I have a very thick southern accent.  I drive a beat up Ford F-150 (have a nice car at home). Donât have a racist bone in my body.  Iâm the kinda fella that encounters racists everyday.  Iâm  in a rural part of Nc.  The wife bought a nightstand off of FB marketplace.  I was sent to retrieve the purchase.  

Via GPS I arrived at a sketchy location.  The fellow meeting me had no shirt, few teeth and plenty of prison tats.  Showed me to the nightstands.  They were stored at the âmeeting houseâ. The meeting house was a single wide trailer gutted except for the second hand pews and stage with an American flag, Christian flag, confederate flag, nazi flag, kkk flag and Trump flag.

Rockford police dragged people from their cars and beat them last night.

Minneapolis police shot at people filming them on their own balconies.

An NYPD officer called a woman a "fucking bitch" and threw her on the ground. She went into a seizure and had to go to the emergency room. Then more New York cops rammed into crowds of protesters with their cars.

An Atlanta couple last night had their tires slashed, windows broken, and were dragged out of their car and tazed.

Chicago police announced a curfew and then raised the bridges out of downtown. Demonstrators were trapped and at the utter mercy of CPD roundups. A police supervisor ordered on the radio, "Gas 'em all." Over 1,000 people have been arrested.

Everywhere, journalists are being indiscriminately targeted and arrested. A Minneapolis photojournalist is blinded permanently in one eye after being hit by a less lethal round.

They've maced children. They've torn off a woman's hijab. They're turning off their body cameras and hiding their badge numbers.

Fargo PD teargassed children.

Buffalo PD teargassed and maced and shot rubberbullets at peaceful protestors after an altercation with a protestor driving their car through the crowd.

This is just what's been documented. Imagine what hasn't been.

The true nature of American policing has been revealed for the world to see. I have never seen brutality on such a massive scale. They don't care if you're peaceful. They don't care if they're on camera.

Black and brown youth are the leaders on the ground. They are the leaders of our future. Black and brown youth are the people who are bleeding, getting beaten, and being thrown into jail. This is trauma that will last their whole lives and be passed down to their children, as it has been passed to them.

To the bail funds. To the phone lines to demand release. We have to protect our people. (Note some cities are not setting bail for protestors this is completely illegal)

If you're going out there again please, and I beg you, be safe.

Fuck the police

Biden and Pelosi have qualities I admire and have taken actions that were needed, but they are still part of a donation system that has to end. They are compromised and addicted to Wall Street, Big Business, and Super PAC money.  They will spend more time fundraising than legislating. They protect Democrats that vote like Republicans.  They will always make marginal changes that will never be enough.  Their donors will always have more access than the working class voters.

Just so I NEVER forget..... April 8, 2020

History in the making. Our world will never be the same. I have faith that very good changes will come of this in the end. 

Non-essential stores and businesses mandated closed 3 weeks ago. Water and power is shut off to businesses who disobey orders.

President Donald Trump approves the Largest stimulus package ever at $2 trillion dollars to try to stimulate our previously strong economy. We all await our $1,200 (per adult) stimulus checks from the government. 

Disneyland and other theme parks close indefinitely, the entire Las Vegas strip closes. Planes fly from coast to coast with only 3 passengers on the entire flight. 

2 weeks ago panic buying sets in and stores have no bottled water, toilet paper, no disinfecting supplies, no paper towels, no hand sanitizer. Shelves are bare. Pasta and rice are no where to be found. Lines at Costco are wrapped around the store and down the street at 6am. 

CA schools are mandated to be closed the rest of the school year and parents are left to homeschool their kids on makeshift online platforms. Childrenâs busy schedules have been simplified. Daily bike rides around the neighborhood are used to keep us all sane. High school Seniors are left without closure to 13 years of k-12 schooling. No prom, no commencement ceremony, nothing. 
 
Self-distancing measures on the rise:
Tape on the floors at grocery stores and banks to help distance shoppers (6ft) from each other and plastic sneeze guards are erected to protect cashiers. Store hours are limited from 8am-8pm. A limited number of people are allowed inside stores at one time so there are long lines outside the store doors in the mornings hoping to get their 1 allotted paper product or 1 gallon of milk per family. 

Parks, trails, beaches, movie theaters are closed, entire cities are under lockdown.

All sports events and seasons cancelled, including the NBA, MLB, and NHL. ESPN is airing classic sport games since there are no live events to televise. Weâre all left to watch Joe Exotic on the Netflix show Tiger King. 

Over 10 million people file for unemployment in the first two weeks of staying at home. The death tole in the USA has reached just over 12,000 people and is projected to exponentially reach 250,000 people in the next few weeks if we all continue to stay at home. 

GM, Ford, and Tesla auto manufacturers switch parts of their assembly lines to help the healthcare industry manufacture defibulators  to help the critically ill.

All concerts, tours, festivals, entertainment events - cancelled.

All weddings, family celebrations, birthdays, holiday gatherings - cancelled.

All churches close and the Pope live-streams a rare plenary indulgence to the faithful. 

Gyms and dine-in only restaurants are closed. Take-out food is still available. Health conscious Americans clammed to buy fitness equipment for their homes.

Curfews are enacted in some cities and gatherings 3 or more are prohibited. Fines are established for breaking the rules. 

There is barely anyone on the roads. Citizens are highly encouraged to self-quarantine, only leaving their homes for essential supplies and to wear masks and gloves while outside. 

Essential service workers are terrified to go to work.  Medical field workers are afraid to go home to their families.

This is the Novel Coronavirus (Covid-19) Pandemic, officially declared by the WHO on March 11th, 2020.

Iâm writing this because one day it will show up in my memory feed, and it will be a reminder that life is precious and not to take things as simple as fully stocked store shelves or lunch with a friend for granted.

"Q: I'm curious about some things that aren't happening on a national scale. One is, why are shelter in place orders happening state by state? Why are we doing this sequentially? Is that a mistake?

A: No, I don't think we could say it's a mistake or not a mistake. There is a discussion and a delicate balance about whatâs the overall impact of shutting everything down completely for an indefinite period of time. So there's a compromise. If you knock down the economy completely and disrupt infrastructure, you may be causing health issues, unintended consequences, for people who need to be able to get to places and can't. You do the best you can. I've emphasized very emphatically at every press conference, that everybody in the country, at a minimum, should be following the fundamental guidelines. Elderly, stay out of society in self isolation. Don't go to work if you don't have to. Yada yada yada. No bars, no restaurants, no nothing. Only essential services. When you get a place like New York or Washington or California, you have got to ratchet it up. But it is felt--and it isn't me only speaking, itâs a bunch of people who make the decisionsâthat if you lock down everything now, you're going to crash the whole society. So you do what you can do, as best as you can. Do as much physical separation as you can and ratchet it up at the places you know are at highest risk."

Why yes, yes it does... Oh, hey! Do you mean that money that PG&E demanded from all their customers and then frittered away instead of doing the work they said they desperately needed... the money they didn't do maintenance with, that eventually caused explosions and deaths in San Bruno? Or Flooding in Santa Cruz? Or wildfires that litterally destroyed entire towns, killed people, and caused irreparable damage to our ecosystem? Yeah, that money.

I AM A TEACHER
I went to college and earned a degree.
I endured state testing.
I was finger printed and background checked.
I trained before, during, and after my training/ education.
I continue to train because I am a lifelong learner.
Since full time employment, I have sacrificed time, sleep, and Family.
I have sacrificed my own money year after year to provide for my students.
I am a teacher.
I have learned, lasted, endured change, endured further change, and endured orders to embrace the change.
While you were sleeping, I have corrected papers and tests, researched and created, and endured harassing phone calls and emails with grace and professionalism.
I teach the kids who live on your streets.
I teach the kids who have been kicked out of psychiatric centers because they were beyond help.
I teach the kids whose home situations you could never imagine even in your worst nightmares.
I teach ALL students no matter their socio-economic status, race, ethnicity, medical/ psychiatric condition, good or poor attitude, religion, family circumstances.
When accused by the federal and state government for being part of a failing system, I endure name calling, shame, and criticism simply because I am a teacher.
I am professionally evaluated on test scores and not the amount of time and effort I put into my teaching (but we're going to change these last two items). 
And despite it all,
I AM a teacher
And devoted to this noble calling.
Thank You to All my fellow educators! ð

In case you donât have time to read the article, here are the highlights: 

âhaving a job doesnât exempt anyone from poverty anymore [...] In Americaâs big cities, chiefly because of a widening gap between rent and wages, thousands of working poor remain homeless, sleeping in shelters, on the streets, or in their vehicles, sometimes along with their families.â 

âNearly half the American population earns too little to live on comfortably: One-third of all workers earn less than $12 an hour and 42% earn less than $15. Thatâs $24,960 and $31,200 a year. Imagine raising a family on such incomes, figuring in the cost of food, rent, childcare, car payments (since a car is often a necessity simply to get to a job in a country with inadequate public transportation), and medical costs.â

âIt takes an average of a little more than $100,000 per year now for a household to be able to live without anxieties about money. Slow and steady inflation has eroded buying power over the past decade. According to The Nation, the minimum wage rose to $7.25 by 2009, but since then inflation has eroded 10% of its buying power. So this year, someone will have to work 41 additional days to make the equivalent of the 2009 minimum wage.â

âHealthcare costs are projected to go up 20% in the coming year. Credit card debt has crested at a trillion dollars and is projected to increase at 4.7% by 2020. Wages have been increasing by only 2.9% per year. For the young, education debt has reached a record $1.52 trillion.â

âWhatâs genuinely astonishing to me is that the private sector doesnât see the immense danger in all thisânot simply the prospect of a collapse from enormous household debt loads, but the prospect of civil unrest after another huge correction like the one in 2008.â

âThere are numerous ways in which our wealthiest companies could help change the course of our economy [...] If every employer in America came up with even just one modest stepâhigher wages, regular profit sharing, tuition reimbursementâto help workers spend and save more, the nation would begin to right itself economically.â

Sheâs very driven, and is currently talking about working waaaay too soon after surgery so she can make ends meet.

This is so true. I'm totally opposed to any gas tax increase. We are already being taxed per gallon for the transportation fund, highest of all States, and that money doesn't need to be used for highway maintenance or repairs. It could be wasted on a High Speed Rail System project (where most of the proposed gas tax money will be spent). The truth is the money is wasted in Sacramento.  When it is used, it benefits large cities, not smaller ones or rural highways, or other transportation projects that benefit everyone. There is a big inequity where the "highway" money" is spent. High populated areas get more of the money, yet so many drivers leave their populated areas to use our rural highways to get to their vacation destinations. This inequity needs to be resolved. So, oppose any gas tax hike, it won't benefit most of us.

ð¡    ð¡    ð¡     After the election Trump's team explained that Melania would be staying in New York because there was "obviously a sensitivity to pulling out a 10-year-old in the middle of the school year."
The cost of security for Melania and Barron to remain at Trump Tower is $183 million/year. So in essence the Federal government is giving the Trump family a $183 million annual voucher so Barron can attend the elite private prep school of his choice.
Meanwhile, Trump's budget would completely eliminate funding for the National Endowment for the Arts. The NEA, with an annual budget of only $148 million, provides seed money for arts programming in literally every Congressional district in the country.
So, on the one hand you have a $183 million school voucher for a single 10-year-old at an elite private school. On the other hand you have a program that improves arts and cultural programming for every child in the nation.

Shared from a friend:

Something To Think About
When someone told Scott Mednick..."We suffered for 8 years. Now itâs your turn.â

Scott wrote a brilliant response asking how exactly his friend, a Trump supporter, had suffered under President Obama.

Scott's reply:
"I am surprised you would wish suffering upon me. That of course is your right, I suppose. I do not wish harm on anyone. Your statement seems to continue an âUS v THEMâ mentality. The election is over. It is important to get past campaigning and campaign rhetoric and get down to what is uniting not dividing and what is best for ALL Americans.

There will never be a President who does everything to everyoneâs liking. There are things President Obama (and President Clinton) did that I do not like and conversely there are things I can point to that the Presidents Bush did that I agree with. So I am not 100% in lock step with the outgoing President but have supported him and the overall job he did.

And, if you recall, during the Presidential Campaign back in 2008 the campaign was halted because of the "historic crisis in our financial system." Wall Street bailout negotiations intervened in the election process. The very sobering reality was that there likely could be a Depression and the world financial markets could collapse.

The United States was losing 800,000 jobs a month and was poised to lose at least 10 million jobs the first year once the new President took office. We were in an economic freefall. So let us recall that ALL of America was suffering terribly at the beginning of Obamaâs Presidency.

But I wanted to look back over the last 8 years and ask you a few questions. Since much of the rhetoric before Obama was elected was that he would impose Sharia Law, Take Away Your Guns, Create Death Panels, Destroy the Economy, Impose Socialism and, since you will agree that NONE of this came to pass,

I was wondering...
Why have you suffered so?
So let me ask:
â¢Gays and Lesbians can now marry and enjoy the benefits they had been deprived of.
Has this caused your suffering?

â¢When Obama took office, the Dow was 6,626. Now it is 19,875.
Has this caused your suffering?

â¢We had 82 straight months of private sector job growth - the longest streak in the history of the United States.

â¢Especially considering where he the economy was when he took over, an amazing 11.3 million new jobs were created under President Obama (far more than President Bush).

â¢President Obama has taken Unemployment from 10% down to 4.7%.

Has this caused your suffering?

â¢People are now covered for pre-existing conditions.
Has this caused your suffering?

â¢Insurance Premiums increased an average of $4,677 from 2002-2008, an increase of 58% under Bush.
The growth of these insurance premiums has gone up $4,145 â a slower rate of increase.
Has this caused your suffering?

â¢Obama added Billions of dollars to mental health care for our Veterans.
Has this caused your suffering?

â¢Consumer confidence has gone from 37.7 to 98.1 during Obamaâs tenure.
Has this caused your suffering?

â¢He passed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. Has this caused your suffering?

â¢His bi-annual Nuclear Summit convinced 16 countries to give up and destroy all their loose nuclear material so it could not be stolen.
Has this caused your suffering?

â¢He saved the US Auto industry. American cars sold at the beginning of his term were 10.4M and upon his exit 17.5M.
Has this caused your suffering?

â¢The deficit as a percentage of the GDP has gone from 9.8% to 3.2%.
Has this caused your suffering?

â¢The deficit itself was cut by $800 Billion Dollars.
Has this caused your suffering?

â¢President Obama preserved the middle class tax cuts.
Has this caused your suffering?

â¢President Obama banned solitary confinement for juveniles in federal prisons. Has this caused your suffering?

â¢He signed Credit Card reform so that rates could not be raised without you being notified.
Has this caused your suffering?

â¢He outlawed Government contractors from discriminating against LGBT persons.
Has this caused your suffering?

â¢He doubled Pell Grants.
Has this caused your suffering?

â¢Abortion is down.
Has this caused your suffering?

â¢Violent crime is down.
Has this caused your suffering?

â¢He overturned the scientific ban on stem cell research.
Has this caused your suffering?

â¢He protected Net Neutrality.
Has this caused your suffering?

â¢Obamacare has extended the life of the Medicare insurance trust fund (will be solvent until 2030).
Has this caused your suffering?

â¢President Obama repealed Don't Ask Don't Tell.

â¢High School Graduation rates hit 83% - an all time high.
Has this caused your suffering?

â¢Corporate profits are up by 144%.
Has this caused your suffering?

â¢He normalized relations with Cuba.
Has this caused your suffering?

â¢Reliance on foreign oil is at a 40 year low. Has this caused your suffering?

â¢US Exports are up 28%.
Has this caused your suffering?

â¢He appointed the most diverse cabinet ever.
Has this caused your suffering?

â¢He reduced the number of troops in both Iraq and Afghanistan.
Has this caused your suffering?

â¢Yes, he killed Osama Bin Laden and retrieved all the documents in his possession for analysis.
Perhaps THIS caused your suffering?

Did he send jackbooted thugs for your guns?
Did he in any way restrict your ability to practice your religion?

From an objective standpoint it would appear that the last 8 years have seen some great progress and we were saved from a financial collapse.

Things are not perfect. Things can always be better. We are on much better footing now than we were in 2008.

I look forward to understanding what caused you to suffer so much under President Obama these last 8 years."

While Trump is the Polar Opposite.
So will somebody PLEASE explain to me what was so horrible.

Prepare for a genuine Yule

Time was that Yule was an entirely Pagan holiday. Heathens celebrated with family gatherings and the exchange of gifts. Wiccans celebrated the Solstice through ritual and a community feast. The day symbolized something. It was the rebirth fo the Year, to celebrate the change from a waning to a waxing Sun. Each locale had its own myth for the season, usually the birth of a God. Norsemen celebrated the birth of Baldur, or Frey, or Thor, as was the custom in their respective regions. For Celts it might be Lugh or one of the other solar deities.

            Most regions had their own legends of a special Yule Visitor. It might be Frau Perchta, bringing candy for good children and spankings for the naughty ones. In some places it was Odin or Tyr or Thor with the wassail bowl, and in others it may be Frigga or Freya. The event was cause for a party, and offerings were left for the Gods. As was the Northern custom, gifts were exchanged with relatives and friends. These were tokens of esteem, often handmade by the giver himself. The ancients were much more crafty and they did their carving and painting and other craftwork during long wintery nights. A roaring fire was lit, featuring a special log. In some places, a tree was brought indoors as a symbol of Yggdrasil.

            What did Yule really mean to the ancient Pagans? It meant a festival that focused on people. The idea was to gather together one last time before the harshest part of winter made travel impossible. Yule was not a harvest festival, but a family gathering. It was a chance for one last visit before the long and lonely days of frigid cold. In one aspect, Yule was akin to a going-away party.

            How very different from our Yule season today!

            I doubt our ancestors would recognize our modern holiday.

            Yule was forcibly supplanted with Christmas by Chrisitianity. The Christian take onYule was the birth of their sun god, Jesus. They changed the trappings, eliminated the best parts, and watered down the rest. Gods were replaced with Santa Claus or Father Christmas. The biggest change came in the 19th Century when Christmas went mercantile. The gift giving boomed as Santa Claus became a magickal toy dispenser.

            The holiday changed slowly but surely. Children became accustomed to getting one major gift and couple of small ones by the 1930s. Families also exchanged gifts, but they were within reasonable limits. Come the 1960s and that all changed. The air waves of Autumn were bombarded with commercials implying that generous gift giving was proof of affection Commercials touted a slew of oddball items: Norelco razors, Hai Karate cologne, battery operated toys and a host of other oddities. Next came shiny aluminum Christmas Trees with a colored light that revolved.

            Today, it is worse. The mercantile madness has hit an all-time high. For most people, the Yule season is a time of extravagant gifting that goes beyond the pale of reason. For children, it includes a glut of expensive toys. Instead of a family gathering, it is a âgimme fest.â Any doubts? Look at the malls. They are packed with people who buy into this giving-glutting malarkey. Look at the television ads. The holiday is buried beneath piles of marketing!

            Wait a second....what holiday? Yule? Or Christmas? How many ads say Yule? That is rare. Most say Christmas. Thatâs the Christian holiday. Weâre Heathens and Pagans. Our holiday is Yule. So why are we confusing the two?

            Living in this society, we are confronted with Christmas. Maybe our relatives celebrate it. It certainly looms large in town. Christmas is a hot item in schools and clubs. We have to deal with Christrmas, to a degree. However, we do not have to take it as our holiday. After all, our holiday is Yule. Christmas is someone elseâs thing . For Heathen and Pagan homes, a lot of the Christmas junk should never enter into the equation.

            We do not need extravagant decorations, nor the overabundant gift glut. Our way is to make the holiday meaningful. . That means real fun. We celebrate our Gods and our Traditions. We have a feast with our fellow Heathens and Pagans. Our gifts should be meaningful, not lavish. And our holiday should be about the people and the Gods

            Decorations should be tasteful, not garish.

            Christmas borrowed most of its traditions and trappings fromYule. Do not let that fool you. CHRISTMAS IS NOT YULE! If we keep that in mind, and act accordingly, we are guaranteed a truly Heathen and Pagan holiday for ourselves.

            Perhaps we all have to make some concessions to Christmas, since few of us live in places that are exclusively Pagan. Christmas is something we deal with for our loved ones who are not Heathen or Pagan. Yule is what we do for ourselves. Make our Yule distinct from Christmas. If we must handle both holidays because of non-Pagan loved ones, keep this rule in mind: Yule is for us, Christmas is for them. In our activities, we should focus on Yule. Christmas is incidental.

By the way, if you have a Yule tree, you can run a toy train underneath in a clockwise directions. This is a form of service to the God Thor. There is nothing Christian about trains and trees. Itâs just a holiday thing they invented in the 20th Century. For us, though, any miniature rolling cart going clockwise is a Thor kind of thing.

I love Bernie Sanders, but I do worry about his healthcare plan. I went to the ER with insurance, had a follow up phone call from a real doctor on Sunday, and was able to get a doctors appointment today to see my regular doctor who I will spend 20 minutes with. All because of health insurance that yes costs way to much but it's better than waiting 30-60 days for another appointment.

It's New Years. Always make me wonder what is in store. This year was such a wonderful year in so many ways. The positives outweigh the negatives by a lot. Even so it was a very rough year. 
Really hoping not to see so many friends pass on. 
Hoping for a better Faire year, now that the van is running it should make things easier,more duties with Macabre this coming year. That will be fun
My wish this coming year is more time with the people that matter most. More small meaningful trips, less time wasted on stuff that has no value.  More money would be nice as well as a better connection with Mother Earth. 
I wish each and every one of you peace and happiness. 
Tagged as many as I could remember, all my friends have been such an important part of this past year. I love you all

The World, at Large âWe are in mourning. Again. Indeed, Paris is in mourning, again.

For the second time in less than a year, we are all de facto Parisians â with Facebook profiles, casinos, and whole buildings draped in the blue, white, and red of the French flag. Solidarity as sympathy, bien sÃ»r â a most poignant message that humanity stands with Paris â and will act decisively to avenge theâcarnageâ unexpectedly wrought by those whose motives most will never fall victim to, much less comprehend.
Evidently, despite the accumulated knowledge of the entire planet at our disposal through the computer screen, solidarity has escaped some of us.

And I am weary.

Without question, I mourn for Parisâ recent victims and their families â and I would never claim knowledgeable firsthand experience of the same. But I refuse â despite my partial French heritage â to cloak myself in nationalism of any stripe or star, particularly not now. Because, besides victims in Paris, an incomprehensibly astronomic number of people have been grieving loss of the highest order for some time â in places whose names roll off our tongues as if itâs accepted that violence simply happens there â and a majority likely couldnât guessthe colors on these victimsâ flags.
You see, I also mourn for those killed mere hours before Paris crumbled into chaos, in strikingly similar attacks in Beirut.
I mourn the hundreds of thousands displaced or killed in Syria, no matter their pledged allegiance. No matter their professed religion. No matter.
I mourn for the millions killed in ongoing and renewed, illegal United Statesâ aggression in Iraq â and those facing a torturous demise from exposure to depleted uranium employed in violation of international and humanitarian law â for reasons far closer to âAmericanâ and corporate hegemony than compassionate principle.

I mourn the untold number killed in the United Statesâ insidious â and seemingly permanent â war in Afghanistan. And the countless children there who know nothing of peace, much less the feeling of safety it brings. And patients and staff recently targeted, bombed, and then shot while fleeing the MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res hospital in Kunduz â and the irony of that humanitarian organizationâs French roots.
I mourn those forced into human slavery or sex trafficking in Malaysia; and curse the scant hope they escape, now that the massive TPP has garnered U.S. governmentâs tacit approval of the abhorrence that is human trade.
I mourn for Palestinians, whose land was usurped â and whose lives and infrastructure and families and sense of security and HOMES are under siege and occupation by an illegal and actively terrorist State.
 
I mourn the patients and staff at the over 100 healthcare facilities in Yemen that have been BOMBED since March. And the apparently soulless who found an acceptable target in hospitals.
I mourn for Yemen.
I mourn for the victims of complicit government violence in Mexico, and 43 students and their families who lack answers.

I mourn for Chinese men, women, and children working, quite literally, as slaves, so the West can be rude at dinner and take endless pictures â of its narcissistically apathetic self.
I mourn rampant genocide â past and present â for the sake of manifest destiny. And empire. And imperialism. And inexplicable and unstated reasons.

In fact, I mourn for all victims of terror, whether State or group sponsored, without conditions attached to my grief â no matter location, nor loyalty, nor arbitrary geopolitical happenstance of location of a victimâs birth. And Iâm already grieving those soon to be terrorâs next victims; since, as French President FranÃ§ois Hollande jarringly warned, avenging Parisâ victims just birthed (yet another) âPITILESSâ war.
As if gentle were somehow a method to employ in waging war.
Yes, I mourn for Paris. But I do so while weeping in shame at the deplorable supercilious judgment ensconced in Western reaction to it; for countless pitiable xenophobes and their endless vapid justifications; for arrogant commentary from politicians and their media mouthpieces with their embarrassing post-tragedy clamoring to exploit ignorant heartstrings for the appropriate victims; for the endless War of Terror â and the service members who somehow havenât yet deduced that this would ALL END if they simply refused to fucking fight.
The fact is, grief on this scale is exhausting. And Iâm very nearly out of tears.
So keep these victims around the globe in mind â every, single man, woman and child who has, who is, and who will suffer the maiming, horror, torture, and death thatâs as necessary to war as those who take up arms â when you next excuse a politicianâs stance on war, because the rest of his or her platform seems really promising.
Or, at least, seems the lesser of two evils.
And shake that flag from your social media profile; and your home; and your thoughts. Because as long as you wear just one flag, your attempt to stand with victims of terror is a most embarrassingly hollow solidarity, indeed.

Sanders, on the other hand, is the antithesis of Clinton. When 72 percent of Americans supported the Iraq War in 2003, Sanders not only voted against the invasion, but foreshadowed its unintended consequences and never allowed intelligence reports to influence his decision-making. During the George W. Bush years, he voted against the Patriot Act at a time when Clinton and other Democrats voted for the controversial legislation. In 1996, as a member of the House of Representatives, Sanders voted against the Defense of Marriage Act (which barred federal recognition of gay marriages), even though 68 percent of Americans were against gay marriage. Regarding our fight against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), Sanders says "I'll be damned" if more American soldiers are sent back to the Middle East, despite 62 percent of registered voters willing to send ground troops. While 65 percent of Americans believe that income inequality is a problem that needs to be "addressed now," Sanders has championed this issue his entire life and blasted then-Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on wealth inequality back in 2003.

Since feeling is first
e.e. cummings 

since feeling is first
who pays any attention
to the syntax of things
will never wholly kiss you;
wholly to be a fool
while Spring is in the world

my blood approves,
and kisses are a better fate
than wisdom
lady i swear by all flowers. Don't cry
âthe best gesture of my brain is less than
your eyelids' flutter which says

we are for each other: then
laugh, leaning back in my arms
for life's not a paragraph

And death i think is no parenthesis

"You control our world. You've poisoned the air we breathe, contaminated the water we drink, and copyrighted the food we eat. We fight in your wars, die for your causes, and sacrifice our freedoms to protect you. You've liquidated our savings, destroyed our middle class, and used our tax dollars to bailout your unending greed. We are slaves to your corporations, zombies to your airwaves,  servants... to your decadence. You've stolen our elections, assassinated our leaders, and abolished our basic rights as human beings. You own our property, shipped away our jobs, and shredded our unions. You've profited off of disaster, destabilized our currencies, and raised our cost of living. You've monopolized our freedom, stripped away our education, and have almost extinguished our flame. We are hit... We are bleeding... but we ain't got time to bleed. We will bring the giants to their knees, and you will witness our revolution!"

Teachers' hefty salaries are driving up taxes, and they only work 9 or 10 months a year! It's time we put things in perspective and pay them for what they do - babysit! We can get that for minimum wage. That's right. Let's give them $3.00 an hour and only the hours they worked; not any of that silly planning time, or any time they spend before or... after school.

That would be $19.50 a... day (7:45 to 3:00 PM with 45 min. off for lunch and plan-- that equals 6 1/2 hours). Each parent should pay $19.50 a day for these teachers to baby-sit their children. Now how many students do they teach in a day...maybe 30? So that's $19.50 x 30 = $585.00 a day. However, remember they only work 180 days a year!! I am not going to pay them for any vacations.

LET'S SEE... That's $585 X 180= $105,300 per year. (Hold on! My calculator needs new batteries). What about those special education teachers and the ones with Master's degrees? Well, we could pay them minimum wage ($7.75), and just to be fair, round it off to $8.00 an hour. That would be $8 X 6 1/2 hours X 30 children X 180 days = $280,800 per year. Wait a minute -- there's something wrong here! There sure is! The average teacher's salary (nation wide) is $50,000. $50,000/180 days = $277.77/per day/30 students=$9.25/6.5 hours = $1.42 per hour per student--a very inexpensive baby-sitter and they even EDUCATE your kids! :) WHAT A DEAL!! Make a teacher smile; re-post this to show appreciation for all educators.

I think of my family who lives moderately but still has financial worries. My father Tom Johosky whose salary comes from the donations of others, when all the jobs are gone what will he do? My mother Cindy Johosky who could get disability for numerous reasons, but has been denied numerous times. My sisterKristi Leigh Araneda who got married to a man from chile who came over legally, and is now forced to live in Chile yet again, after coming to america, and marrying an American, because of a loophole. 

That's not even going into my extended family who has equal if not greater problems. I am only one person, I cannot help everyone.  Am I part of the WE ARE 99 Percent movement? is college where I should be, trying to get a degree for a better future, when the only thing that awaits me is nothing. 3 of my friends are about to finish an internship and will not be hired. They just spent an outragious amount of money for this education, that has no jobs. What then am I to do. Drop everything and go protest? or stay at home and attempt to forget the outside world? Should I stay in school, or is my money being spent in vain? 

Facebook friends please feel free to comment or message me, as i am truly at a crossroads right now, and could desperately use some advice from people who are, were, or have been in my position. 
Thanks
Josh

Although the IZA study was conducted in 2004, there is little to suggest that much has changed over the last five years. In fact, it has likely only gotten worse for African-Americans. Whereas in 2004, the American economy was relatively stable and black unemployment was 10.4 percent with white unemployment at 4.8 percent
